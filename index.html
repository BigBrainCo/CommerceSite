				<li>Pre and post sales</li>
				<li>Makes the customer feel valued</li>
				<li>Keeps them coming back</li>
				</ul>
				<p>E.g. when serving a customer, the employee must have:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Good knowledge of the products</p></li>
					<li><p>Friendly attitude</p></li>
					<li><p>Quick/efficient service</p></li>
					<li><p>Problem solving skills to aid the customer’s decisions</p></li>

				<h2>Service</h2>
				<ul class="lists">
				<li>Defined as the consumer as being aided in the shopping process, often by the shopkeepers or employees.</li>
				<li>Service allows the consumer to make more informed decisions, as those serving are expected to have extensive knowledge of the products.
					<br>Additionally, this knowledge should be provided in a friendly and efficient manner that makes the customer feel welcome and valued.
					</li>
					<li>The customer’s lack of knowledge shouldn’t be taken advantage of, as if exposed this foul play will drive off not only the original customer but many more who also hear about it.</li>
					<li>Service is arguably the most important part of retaining customers; just a cheap price tag is often not enough.</li>
