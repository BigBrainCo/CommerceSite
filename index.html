  <h1 class="bigtitle">Key factors affecting consumer decisions</h1>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<div class="page firstdiv">
  <h1 class="bigtitle">Service</h1>
  <p>
    Service is generally defined for the consumer as being aided in the shopping process, often by the shopkeepers or employees.<br>
    Service allows the consumer to make more informed decisions, as those serving are expected to have extensive knowledge of the products.<br>
    Additionally, this knowledge should be provided in a friendly and efficient manner, that makes the customer feel welcome and valued.<br>
    Finally, the customer’s lack of knowledge shouldn’t be taken advantage of, as if exposed this foul play will drive off not only the original customer but many more who also hear about it.<br> 
    Service is arguably the most important part of retaining customers; just a cheap price tag is often not enough.

<div class="page firstdiv">
  <h1 class="bigtitle">Price</h1>
  <p>
    Price is often the deciding factor as to what to buy, and is therefore one of the more important details for the consumer. It is important that the product is priced competitively in comparison to competition, it must be of a better value than what others can provide. Value can be derived by weighing the benefits of a product against the cost. It is also important that companies have products of the same genre at different price ranges, as everyone has a different budget for what they are buying. By providing products at different prices with different features dependant on the price, companies can effectively cover all bases that a consumer could want.

<div class="page firstdiv">
  <h1 class="bigtitle">Convenience</h1>
  <p>
   Convenience is the ease at which the consumer can access goods or services. This category can be divided up between brick and mortar stores and online services. For brick and mortar stores, convenience is the travel time to and from the store, the opening hours and whether the stores selling similar products are close together or far away. The first factor, travel time, is fairly self explanatory: simply it is how long it will take for the consumer to get there. As for opening hours it is important that they are in line with the average consumer’s shopping schedule. For most, this will be on weekends, so it is important that shops are also open then. Finally, the consumer is much more likely to attend an area with a high density of stores that sell similar products than a low density. This is because if their is an issue with a product and the consumer doesn't want to buy it, they can simply visit another store in the area rather than having to drive somewhere else far away. Online services are much more simple, with a main factor of convenience being shipping times and a well constructed website. These both aim to improve the ease and speed of using an online service, and are often more convenient than brick and mortar store if executed correctly, due to the lack of travel needed to shop.

  <h1 class="bigtitle">Marketing</h1>
  <p>
    Marketing is the exposure of a product to a consumer and is one of the best ways of convincing the consumer to consider buying the product. In order for a consumer to potentially buy something, they must first know that it even exists, and this is what marketing must do whilst also painting the product in a positive light. Additionally, successful marketing campaigns must also appeal more specifically to the right demographic, that is the group of people the product is aimed at. Marketing isn’t just an advertisement, but can include where the advertisement is placed, when it is shown and how it is communicated. These decisions must be carefully made in order to create the most positive image of a product.

  <section>
<div class="page firstdiv">
  <h1 class="bigtitle">Gender</h1>
  <p>
    Gender in marketing is the abuse of gender and the stereotypes that go along with it to more effectively sell products. Through making two slightly different products each marketed for a specific gender, companies can split the market between the two genders and increase revenue. Interestingly, these products are often identical in every way except marketing and packaging, in which they heavily emphasise either the manliness or girliness of a product. In doing so, shoppers are often only exposed to the product associated with their gender, leading to an overpriced purchase in comparison to other options. For shoppers looking to save money, it is often a good idea to check out the other gender’s side of the mall before purchasing.
